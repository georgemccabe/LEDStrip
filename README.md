# LEDString

Arduino project using the FastLED library to control LED light strips.

Program cycles through different light patterns such as:

* Single color fill from one end to the other changing color at each endpoint

* Single color fill alternating forward and backwards direction changing color
  at each endpoint

* "Candy cane" alternating colors

* Strobe random colors

* Fade brightness for single color on all lights
